# **Custom Crosshair**

![Creds: Metami septiana on flaticon](https://github.com/william0578/custom-crosshair/blob/main/crosshair.png)

an application that allows you to import a custom image to use as a crosshair, made with **Python** and will recieve updates (such as resizing etc.) in the future.

## **Installation**

To install it:
1. Get the latest `.exe` file from the `Releases` tab.
2. Run the `.exe` file.
3. Windows Defender will flag it as a **threat**, but I will link the VirusTotal (once I've done it)

## **Usage/Guide**

To use the app it will pop up above all other windows.
You can hide the bar that has the **"Image Selector"** the **"Lock (🔒)"**, the **"Close (❌)"** and the **"Recenter (🔄️)"** using `Ctrl + Shift + C`

The **"Image Selector"** allows you to select any **Image File** as a crosshair. It will auto-center when selected.

The **"Lock (🔒)"** allows you to freeze the selected crosshair in it's current location on your screen.

The **"Close (❌)""** closes the application, and is the only way to close it (apart from `Task Manager`) as it does not show up in the **system tray**.

The **"Recenter (🔄️)"** recenters the application to the center of the screen.

You can drag on any of the buttons shown above to move the crosshair around (or the actual image once imported).

I do not care what you do with this and have added the python file in the files.

If you prefer to run it without a `.exe` file, I will put instruction's below:

## **Run with Python**

1. Enter: `pip install PyQt6` into the **Terminal** to install the required packages.
2. Download the `custom-crosshair.py` from the `Releases` tab.
3. Navigate **Command Prompt** to the **Download** location (e.g enter `cd C:/Users/YOURNAME/Downloads`/`cd [the location the file's stored]`)
4. Once your **Terminal** shows that you are in the folder with the file, run `python custom-crosshair.py` and the window should pop up.

This program is still heavily under-developed and may not work properly.

If you do use this for anything, credit would be greatly appreciated 😊
